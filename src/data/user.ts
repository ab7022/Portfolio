  about: `
Hello, World! I am Abdul Bayees — a FullStack Engineer passionate about creating high-performance, user-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs.

With 2+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React Native, React, TypeScript, and modern front-end & backendtechnologies. Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality through personal projects.

One of my key projects, [DevlopAI](https://devlop.app), 
makes building a mobile app as simple as describing it. In under a minute, it creates a complete full-stack app with React Native, pixel-perfect UI, and ready-to-use backend. In just three months, it reached 2,000+ signups, 11,000+ active users, and $X in revenue.

I’ve worked as a Frontend Developer Intern, led as a college club coordinator, and built [Eazyfolio](https://eazyfolio.com), which reached 25,000+ active users. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications (MCA) online and am an immediate joiner.



Let's connect and collaborate!
